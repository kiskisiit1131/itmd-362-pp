# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/interaction/navigation/
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
One of the biggest downfalls in the original myIIT page was that it's painful to navigate. With our redesign, we made navigating simple. 
If you type in your username and password, the login button will pop up. If you scroll down and are looking for support information, you can
toggle that info. This creates a clear and consise path throughout our login page. 

* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742479(v=vs.85).aspx#layout
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
Another big issue was the layout. The login area is way too small and the user is overloaded with unnecessary information on the login screen.
We balanced out the layout so the username and password are big and easy to use, and eliminated any unnecessary information on the page. We decided
to leave in support information because we felt like that was something any user might need.
* HCI Guidline Three (URL): https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/design-principles.html.en
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
The purpose of the login page is for the user to log in. Seems obvious, but it needs to be said because on the my IIT page 
it's hard to tell what the focus of the page is. This is why we opted for a big, centered layout for the mobile screens so the user's 
attention is drawn to the username and password portions of the page immediately.
