## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=54-0T0klqngBPsGspqxfMkX9Miu
Your Rationale: Being a big Nintendo fan, this palette was inspired by the GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and even the Super Nintendo. 
So many consoles are either black or white, I liked how Nintendo would change it up and make consoles that had purple and blue on them.

2. A triadic color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=32S0T0keRz7qjI+kJA784vU5gso
Your Rationale: When I think gardens, I think in pastels. This palette has the pastel colors you would expect; I feel like it has an Easter feel to it.
This palette is bright and lively, perfect for announcing garden tours.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=33J100kvUkHrNnErfmcGiiDGbhh
Your Rationale: I noticed that a lot of messenging apps use either blue or green. I wanted to build off that and add in red too, I think it
adds a nice contrast to the palette.

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=100100klqmcldcOlqhikMBrlduw
Your Rationale: Since Ruby on Rails uses the color red for their logo, I decided to go with a red palette. I didn't want it to be
like a Chicago Bulls red, but something easier on the eyes so people would be interested in reading the advertisement that utilizes this
palette and sign up for the course.
