# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: To me, a bobby pin is not beautiful. It isn't asthetically pleasing to the eye, a bumpy black metal pin that I shove into my hair.
It is, however, a necessity for my hair so I use it regardless. The fact that it can blend in my hair easily and hide how unasthetically pleasing it
looks is a plus on the visceral side of design. 

* Behavioral: The bobby pin excels in this category, it hold my bangs back perfectly. The way the ridges are designed on it makes this simple for the user.
If I ever have my hair up and stray hair falls, the bobby pin will not only hold the hair up, but blend in with my hair as well so you can't even tell 
that my hair fell at all and I needed the use of one. 

* Reflective: There's really no reflective appeal to me about the bobby pin, except that it performs the task I need it to in a minimalist way.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:
